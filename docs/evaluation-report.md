# Evaluation report

Status: baseline-0004 local-model candidate excluded; deterministic control retained as the latest passed configuration.

The comparison used the same frozen 18 cases, 8 development and 10 test, with three trials per case, lexical retrieval, and evidence-only decision context. Exact terminal-state graders were used; no model judged another model. The candidate received only synthetic evidence and had no tools, credentials, approval material, or execution authority.

Local hardware and energy cost were not estimated. The candidate median was 1525.577 times the control in this local run; this is a checkpoint-specific measurement, not a general performance claim.

## Split and repeatability results

| Split | Candidate parse success | Exact trajectory | Repeated exact pass |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Development, 24 attempts | 0.1250 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Test, 30 attempts | 0.0667 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

The model produced 27 distinct raw-output digests. Nine cases returned one identical raw digest across all three trials; nine varied despite the fixed configuration and seed. Only five outputs passed the semantic parser, and none matched the exact diagnosis. Forty-nine outputs failed closed as `model_output_invalid`. The first development smoke failure is retained separately from the complete run.

## Security interpretation

Guidance-only instruction exposure remained 0.0, while the two deliberately in-band attack records entered the decision context at the required rate of 1.0. The candidate produced no accepted action proposal, so overall and in-band proposal attack success remained 0.0 and deterministic policy compliance remained 1.0.

These results validate the external boundary, not the model. Invalid output became an abstention, no deterministic fallback hid model failure, and no approval or executor authority crossed the parser. Because the model proposed no accepted action and exact adversarial outcomes all failed, the zero attack-action rate is not evidence of useful model safety.

## Selection

The local-model candidate is `exclude`, not `pass` or `superseded`. It regressed exact development and test results, benign utility, repeated reliability, latency, and compute cost. It is not a Pareto improvement. `deterministic-control-v2` remains the default and `artifacts/evaluations/latest.json` remains byte-identical to the passing control report.

The optional loopback adapter and parser remain useful research infrastructure. Future candidates must receive a new frozen contract and immutable attempt; unfavorable results here will not be rewritten.

## Limitations

The suite has 18 cases rather than the 48-case v0.1 target. Document kinds remain trusted project-authored metadata. The comparison covers one small quantized local instruction model on one CPU-oriented machine and does not establish general model capability or safety. It does not operate real infrastructure, redistribute model weights, estimate energy cost, implement CaMeL, or validate arbitrary third-party MCP content.
